This frameworks eases the usage of the [emfcloud-modelserver](https://github.com/eclipse-emfcloud/emfcloud-modelserver) validation capabilities.

This model validation framework supports:
- Triggering a validation of a specific model
- Subscribing to validation result changes (e.g. when the model has changed)
- Retrieving a list of constraints that can be used for input validation
- Keeping a list of constraints that are turned off

## ChangeListener
The ValidationResultChangeListener can be used to update the representation of the ValidationResults everytime the ValidationResult for a specific model has changed.

## InputValidation
The framework contains a Map from ElementId and FeatureId (defined in the metamodel) to an EMFFacetConstraints object. This object contains all of the facets that are defined in the metamodel for the specific feature.

## Filtering Constraints
The framework also keeps a list of all the code/source (defined in the metamodel) pairs, that should be filtered. They can either be turned on/off or can be toggled.
